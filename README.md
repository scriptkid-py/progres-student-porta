Progres is an independently developed remake of Progres/Webetu with a focus on enhanced user experience.

I built this app because the original student portal (Progres/Webetu) is... well, not the best. It’s slow, outdated, and not very user-friendly. I wanted something faster, cleaner, and more reliable
So I decided to rebuild it from scratch, with a better design and offline support. It's open-source too, so that anyone can improve it.

> **Note:** This application is not officially affiliated with Progres/Webetu or any educational institution.

## Key Features

- **Modern UI/UX** - Intuitive interface built with Material Design 3
- **Bilingual Support** - Full support for both Arabic scripts
- **Enhanced Performance** - Optimized for speed and reliability
